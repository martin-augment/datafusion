# Metrics

DataFusion operators expose runtime metrics so you can understand where time is spent and how much data flows through the pipeline. See more in [EXPLAIN ANALYZE](sql/explain.md#explain-analyze).

## Common Metrics

### BaselineMetrics

Helper for creating and tracking common "baseline" metrics for each operator

| Metric          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| end_time        | end_time is set when `BaselineMetrics::done()` is called                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| elapsed_compute | amount of time the operator was actively trying to use the CPU                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| output_rows     | output rows: the total output rows                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| output_bytes    | Memory usage of all output batches. Note: This value may be overestimated. If multiple output `RecordBatch` instances share underlying memory buffers, their sizes will be counted multiple times. Issue: <https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/16841> |
| output_batches  | output batches: the total output batch count                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### BuildProbeJoinMetrics

Metrics for build & probe joins

| Metric              | Description                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| build_time          | Total time for collecting build-side of join                        |
| build_input_batches | Number of batches consumed by build-side                            |
| build_input_rows    | Number of rows consumed by build-side                               |
| build_mem_used      | Memory used by build-side in bytes                                  |
| join_time           | Total time for joining probe-side batches to the build-side batches |
| input_batches       | Number of batches consumed by probe-side of this operator           |
| input_rows          | Number of rows consumed by probe-side this operator                 |
| probe_hit_rate      | Fraction of probe rows that found more than one match               |
| avg_fanout          | Average number of build matches per matched probe row               |

## Operator-specific Metrics

### FilterExec

FilterExec evaluates a boolean predicate against all input batches to determine which rows to include in its output batches.

#### FilterExecMetrics

The metrics for `FilterExec`

| Metric      | Description                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| selectivity | Selectivity of the filter, calculated as output_rows / input_rows |

### NestedLoopJoinExec

NestedLoopJoinExec is a build-probe join operator designed for joins that do not have equijoin keys in their `ON` clause.

#### NestedLoopJoinMetrics

| Metric      | Description                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| selectivity | Selectivity of the join: output_rows / (left_rows \* right_rows) |
